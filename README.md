# Pandemic Simulator

Pandemic Simulator is an app that allows you to create a 2 dimensional game board and simulate a pandemic. A selection group allows users to choose between setting tiles to immune or infected and the "Start Pandemic" button will show the user, turn-by-turn, how their pandemic unfolds.
